There are a variety of cash advances, but the common denominators among all of them are the stiff interest rates and fees.

The most popular type of cash advance is borrowing on a line of credit through a credit card. The money can be withdrawn at an ATM or, depending on the credit card company, from a check that is deposited or cashed at a bank. Credit card cash advances typically carry an interest rate that is higher than the rate for regular purchases. Whatâ€™s more, the interest begins to accrue immediately; there is no grace period.
