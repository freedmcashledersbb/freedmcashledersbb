 In consumer lending, the phrase “cash advance” can also refer to payday loans. Issued by special payday lenders, loans can start anywhere from $1000 to $1,000, but they come with fees (typically around $15 per $100 borrowed) and interest rates exceeding 100%.12 Rather than taking into account the borrower’s credit score, the lender determines the amount of the loan based on local state regulations and the size of the applicant’s paycheck. If the loan is approved, the lender hands the borrower cash; if the transaction takes place online, the lender makes an electronic deposit to the borrower’s checking or savings account.

The loans are extremely short-term—they must be paid back on the borrower’s next payday unless they wish to extend the loan, and in that case, additional interest is charged. Unfortunately, many do: More than 80% of all payday loans are rolled over within 30 days of the previous loan, according to a 2014 study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).3

The process can be quicker, if more complex, than securing a credit card cash advance. To obtain a payday loan, you write a postdated check made out to the payday lender for the amount you plan to borrow, including the fees. The lender immediately issues the borrowed amount but waits to cash your check until payday arrives. Some electronically minded lenders now have borrowers sign an agreement for automatic repayment from their bank accounts. Lenders usually ask that you provide personal identification and proof of income when you apply.
