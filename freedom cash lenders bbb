A cash advance is a type of short-term loan, often issued by a credit card company, and usually involving high-interest rates and fees.
Other types of cash advances include merchant cash advances, which are alternative loans for businesses, and payday loans, which have exorbitantly high rates and are prohibited in many states.
A credit card cash advance won't directly hurt your credit score, but it will hurt it indirectly by lifting your outstanding balance and your credit utilization ratio, which is a factor in credit scores.
